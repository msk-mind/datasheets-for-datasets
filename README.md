# Pathology Data Mining

The datasheets in this repo document structured (or tabular) data used by the Pathology Data Mining team. The data encompasses modalities listed in the Datasets section below. [template.md](https://github.com/msk-mind/datasheets-for-datasets/blob/main/template.md) describes the schema of each datasheet. The template has been designed to give a sense of completeness to the documentation behind a dataset, for ease of use, and for ease of maintenance. This template should be used as a guide for the creation and maintenace of these datasheets. 

## Datasets:

Clinical Data Mining (CDM) - Datasets generated from abstracting data elements from clinical reports <br/>
IMPACT - MSK IMPACT genomic datasets <br/>
HoBBit - Pathology slide inventory datasets <br/>
Pathology Data Mining (PDM) - Datasets generated from abstracting data elements from pathology slides <br/>
